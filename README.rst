django-sitetools
==============

Django application with general site tools. It includes:

* Multiple site management
* A legal documents management system
* A database based logging system
* Various middleware for multi-site, language SEO friendly redirects, etc.
* Tool functions related to website development

The idea is to provide an "All in One" app that contains the basis for almost
every website.

The app is created taking in account you may not need some parts of it, so they can be enabled/disabled separately.

Most of this application has been taken from evodjango and some other pieces
of software used in some of my web projects.
